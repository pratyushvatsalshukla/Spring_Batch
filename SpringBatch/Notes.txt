What is Job and Step
Each transaction is a separate Job.
Each Job can contain multiple Steps.

Transaction  --- Debit Money
             \
               -  Send Sms / email to Customer

Steps : Can be of Two Types :
1. Tasklet (Based on Tasks)
2. Chunks Based ( We hae Item Reader -> Item Processor -> Item Writer)

We use Chunk Based approach when we have high volume of Data
